# Income Prediction Project

Welcome to the Income Prediction Project! This guide will help you set up the project environment and install all the necessary dependencies. For the best experience, we recommend using Anaconda Navigator.

## Quick Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Install Anaconda Navigator

If you haven't already, download and install [Anaconda Navigator](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution). Anaconda simplifies package management and deployment.

### Step 2: Create a New Environment

Open Anaconda Navigator and create a new environment for this project. This helps to keep dependencies organized and prevents conflicts with other projects.

### Step 3: Install Project Dependencies

Activate your new environment and open a terminal. Run the following command to install all required dependencies:

```bash
pip install patsy statsmodels ydata-profiling pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy streamlit scikit-learn
